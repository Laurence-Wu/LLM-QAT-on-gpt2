For the current ptoject

1. YOu should always solve the problem instead of taking another way arround
2. you should not use the hasattr function, handle all the edge case with throw errors.
3. If not explicitly expressed, you should print instead of doing the logging information.
4. When printing out the debugging or error information, always use the data from the script or variables from the script, instead of the hardcoded inforamtion.
